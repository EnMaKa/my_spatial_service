## My geocoder example

This is a study project to create a reverse geocoding application based on flask and a sqlite data base. The flask application provides a small webpage with a leaflet.js application running on it. The database is build on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The OSM-data was downloaded from [Geofabrik](http://www.geofabrik.de) and was edited with the sqlite extension spatialite (version 4). 

To be able to use a reverse geocoder, it was necessary to select the node information (the node ids and their geometry) and the adresses which are connected to the node id. 


##### Frameworks used

For this project I used: 

- Flask (version 0.12.2)
- Leaflet 
- SQLite (version 3.9.2)
- SQLite extension Spatialite (version 4.3.0a)
- SQLIte extension Spatialite-tools (version 4.3.0)


### Get the project started

Description how to set up the project on own system.

#### Install Frameworks

For this project I used the frameworks listed above and with some skripts they'll install very easy just look [here](https://github.com/EnMaKa/my_spatial_service/tree/master/libs).

#### Data
Like I said, the used data for this geocoder example is ready to download at [Geofabrik](http://www.geofabrik.de). There I used the OSM database file for Bremen (bremen-latest.osm.pdf).

For a reverse geocoder it is necessary to connect the node information with the adresses that belongs to the node.id with their geometry. Therefore I used some SQL-Statements that you will find in the same folder.

1. Create table with node.id, address and  then add geometry column
2. Create another table with the merged node informations from other tabels
3. Transfer information info first table
4. Create spatial index for faster search results

#### Flask
For this project I used Flask as backend service. For those never worked with Flask - it is written in python and in my opion pretty easy as node.js to start with. 

The flask backend will provide information about coordinates and streetnames. 

Extesions used:
- g 
- request 
- jsonify
- sqlite3 
- sys

#### Make an API-Call
When the server runs, you can make two different calls to get informations from the database.

##### 1. Get coordination based information
The first call makes an request to the spatialite DB to get the address name and number based on coordinations.

1. Example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/geocode?lat=981325&lon=6997858 

2. Exmaple: http://127.0.0.1:5000/geocode?lat=981325&lon=6997858&buffer_size=150

##### 2. Get Adresses based information
The second call will look at the informations that are given with a certain streetname.

Example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/locatestreet?address=Br√ºggeweg


#### Known Issues
In this example there are some "bugs" that might be related to the database. 
One known issue is that, if you click on the map and try to get the location you might not get the informatio that you thought you'll get. 

The OSM node informations could not be called like they should. You get an address near to the lokation you've clicked, but not the right.
