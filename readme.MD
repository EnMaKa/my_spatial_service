## My geocoder example

This is a study project to create a reverse geocoding application based on flask and a sqlite data base. The flask application provides a small webpage with a leaflet.js application running on it. The database is build on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The OSM-data was downloaded from [Geofabrik](http://www.geofabrik.de) and was edited with the sqlite extension spatialite (version 4). 

To be able to use a reverse geocoder, it was necessary to select the node information (the node ids and their geometry) and the adresses which are connected to the node id. 


##### Frameworks used

For this project I used: 

- Flak (version 0.12.2)
- Leaflet 
- SQLite (version 3.9.2)
- SQLite extension Spatialite (version 4.3.0a)
- SQLIte extension Spatialite-tools (version 4.3.0)


### Get the project started

Description how to set up the project on own system.

##### Data
Like I said, the used data for this geocoder example is ready to download at [Geofabrik](http://www.geofabrik.de). There I used the OSM database file for Bremen (bremen-latest.osm.pdf).

For a reverse geocoder it is necessary to connect the node information with the adresses that belongs to the node.id with their geometry. Therefore I used some SQL-Statements that you will find in the same folder. 

##### Flask
For this project I used Flask as backend service. For those never worked with Flask - it is written in python and in my opion pretty easy as node.js to start with. 

#### Make an API-Call
When the server runs, you can make two different calls to get informations from the database.

##### 1. Get coordination based information
The first call makes an request to the spatialite DB to get the address name and number based on coordinations.

Example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/geocode?lat=981325&lon=6997858 


##### 2. Get Adresses based information
The second call will look at the informations that are given with a certain streetname.

Example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/locatestreet?address=Br√ºggeweg
